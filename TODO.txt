20190912 - Work to see how to put this up on heroku
    It appears that I need to change db to mysql or postgres, for productin
    and then make it so I'm pushing the production version to heroku
See if I can get the integration with ThriveCart to work
Work on the gathering of 'fillins' and then apply them to the templates
Work out applying what we do now with the single text message and apply
    that to doing groups using templates.
Figure out how to get the TextMagic replies to be posted to the app.
